Welcome to my first blog post!
</br>
So yeah i will post some small blogs on here! Nothing much really just some ideas or my personal opinions on somehting.
</br>
As you can see for now this is VERY basic for now. If it gets any popular i might use something like writefreely or shit like that. But for now just straight old HTML works fine for me.
</br>
If you got any recomandations for this website or blog u can just send me the recomandations <a href="/contact.html/" target="_blank">Here</a>. So yeah very simple.
