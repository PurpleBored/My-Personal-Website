So yeah i used my brain for once and i got an idea. So i decided to tell yall about it. I recently checked out neal.fun which is a very good website.
And i decided that i wanna make something simlar just some small fun games which u can play in a browser. Nothing much really. Maybe some Tic tac toe with AI or snake or some shit.
I was also considering maybe making a full on Text based RPG. But that's a project for a later date lol.
I will probably start the work on this soon. I should have it done this year (execpt that text based RPG). I will first need to improve my JS skills cause they are really bad rn. I can barley do shit.
But anyways if u got any idea for some other SIMPLE games i could do on here just send me the idea <a href="/contact.html/" target="_blank">Here</a>. and i will credit you for the idea or some shit like that.
