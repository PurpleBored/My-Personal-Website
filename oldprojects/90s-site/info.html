<p><a href="https://purplebored.pl/">Return to main site.</a></br>===INFO===<p>
So this was just a simple website i did it. It was 90 themed and even worked on old netscape. I even created a PHP guestbook for it. (Which was sadly abused.)</br>
I did this site mostly cause i was bored asf. And i also wanted to have a site with a 90s theme. Fun fact it technicly replaced my main site for a month. After a month i created a new website.
