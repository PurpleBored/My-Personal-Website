So this was just a simple website I did. It was 90s-themed and even worked on old Netscape. I even created a PHP guestbook for it. (Which was sadly abused.)</br>
I did this site mostly because I was bored, and I also wanted to have a site with a 90s theme. Fun fact, technically, it temporarily replaced my main site for a month. After a month, I created a new website.
