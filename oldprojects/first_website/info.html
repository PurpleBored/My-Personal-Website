<a href="https://purplebored.pl/">Return to main site.</a></br>===INFO===
So this was my very first persoanl website / porfolio. I still think the site aged really well and I still very much like it. This site was made with the help of AI and google lol. </br>At first i did that site as a school project but then i realised that i actually kinda like doing it.</br>
I would personaly call this as the thing which got me into coding especialy some basic webdev.
After like a year or two i am realizing i did a lot of things wrong here like the easter egg where you could say i just straight up skidded.
