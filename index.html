===About Me===

Hi welcome to my crappy website (the code behind the website looks even worse turst me). I am Niko aka Purplebored I love to troll and spread missinformation online (but not here no missinfomation here!!).
I mostly just shitpost sometimes i try to learn programing but it never works out the most i know is just a lil bit of HTML JS and CSS and some C# and C++ (VERY basic C++ and C# lmfao). </br>(I am also Polish so my English skill aint too good! If you see a typo you can just let me know about it or make the change yourself on Github or Codeberg)
Wanna go to my Old site? (No idea why this is a lot better!) In that case just go <a href="/old/" target="_blank">Here!</a>
I am planning to add some random content to this website like some small reviews or some software recomandations nothing special really just yet another personal website.

===Shit i self host=== </br>btw this cool dark purple is a hyperlink ^^
<a href="https://bin.purplebored.pl/" target="_blank">My Private Pastebin instance (Very cool!)</a>
<a href="https://oldpb.purplebored.pl/" target="_blank">My Private Zerobin instance (Privte Bin but older)</a>
<a href="https://speed.purplebored.pl/" target="_blank">A LibreSpeed instance using a Polish server located in Warsaw.</a>

===Content=== </br>(That's the reviews and recomandations and shit i use)
<a href="things.html" target="_blank">Software and things i use</a>
<a href="blog.html" target="_blank">My Blog (!!Still learning how to blog don't hate on me!!)</a>

===My Projects=== </br>I am not cooking rn so nothing here!

===My OLD Projects=== </br>So i had some VERY basic old projects before. I am not putting them under "My Projects" cause i am not mantaining them anymore and they are really bad lol.

neko.purplebored.pl - Well this was a very simple project which took me like 30 minutes. I did it mostly to learn some more about APIs. You can check it out <a href="/oldprojects/neko/index.html" target="_blank">here.</a> You can read about why and how i made it <a href="/oldprojects/neko/info.html" target="_blank">here.</a>
purplebored.pl (OG) - Well this was my very first website. The code is so messy on there that it's insane. I still like it tough. I think it looks really good for a first time with AI help. You can check it <a href="/oldprojects/first_website/index.html" target="_blank">here.</a> You can also read about why and how i made it <a href="/oldprojects/first_website/info.html" target="_blank">here.</a>
old.purplebored.pl - As the name may suggest this is NOT my "old" site. It's just a 90s themed website i did for fun. It even had a working guest book! (Which was abused to make it redirect to pornhub). You can visit it <a href="/oldprojects/90s-site/index.html" target="_blank">here.</a> And to learn more just go <a href="/oldprojects/90s-site/info.html" target="_blank">here.</a>
pass.purplebored.pl - Thank god not a password manager but a simple password generator. I did this site for fun and as a simple learning project. You can check it out <a href="/oldprojects/pass/index.html" target="_blank">here.</a> You can also read about why and how i made it <a href="/oldprojects/pass/info.html" target="_blank">here.</a>
cat.purplebored.pl - Just a simple cat site which grabs random cat pics. You can check it out <a href="/oldprojects/cat/index.html" target="_blank">here.</a> You can also read about why and how i made it <a href="/oldprojects/cat/info.html" target="_blank">here.</a>
